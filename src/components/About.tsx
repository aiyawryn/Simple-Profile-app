          About Bejimaru
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
          Bejimaru is a cute, stubborn dog from Kanagawa with three siblings. He
          loves cats but avoids other dogs. He refuses dog food unless bribed
          with snacks, and pretends to be hungry just to get more treats. His
          best friend is a stuffed bird, and he spends his days playing tag. At
          night, he snores peacefully… and farts so smelly it could clear the
          whole room.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
          Bejimaru is clingy, snack‑obsessed, impatient, a motorcycle fan, a cat
          watcher, and now… an elevator enthusiast.
